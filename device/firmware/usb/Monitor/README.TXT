EzUsb Monitor Files Directory: uVision2 compatable monitor files.

The files in this directory are monitor files. They are loaded into the target 
(EZ-USB) board and serve as an interface to the Keil debugger so that you can 
view target memory, step through code, set breakpoints, etc.

The files in this directory are:

-- mon-ext-sio1-e0.hex (formerly mon-64K.hex) -- 
   The 64K monitor for the Keil debugger. 
   This is the default monitor loaded automatically at startup
   for EZ-USB and EZ-USB FX. 
   You may therefore use the Keil debugger without explicitly 
   loading this monitor yourself (it is done for you). 
   It may also be manually downloaded using the control panel. 
   This version uses sio1 and external memory from 0xe000-0xef75.
-- mon-ext-sio1-e0.m51 (formerly mon-64K.m51) -- 
	The map file generated for this version of the debugger.

-- mon-ext-sio1-c0.hex -- 
   The 64K monitor for the Keil debugger. 
   This is the default monitor loaded automatically at startup
   for FX2. Since the FX2 monitor could not load at 0xe000
   (there are registers there in FX2), this alternate monitor is 
   loaded.
   You may therefore use the Keil debugger without explicitly 
   loading this monitor yourself (it is done for you). 
   It may also be manually downloaded using the control panel. 
   This version uses sio1 and external memory from 0xc000-0xcf75.
-- mon-ext-sio1-c0.m51 -- 
	The map file generated for this version of the debugger.

-- mon-ext-sio0-c0.hex -- 
   A version of the external memory monitor that uses the first serial port
   (sio0).  Download this file with the control panel prior to using it 
   with the Keil debugger. 
   This version uses sio0 and external memory from 0xc000-0xcf75.
-- mon-ext-sio0-c0.m51 -- 
	The map file generated for this version of the debugger.

-- mon-int-sio1.hex (formerly mon-8k.hex) -- 
   A version of the monitor for the Keil debugger that 
   uses only internal memory.  Download this file
   with the control panel prior to using it with the Keil debugger. 
   This version uses sio 1 and loads at 0x0000-0x1075.
-- mon-int-sio1.m51 (formerly mon-8K.m51) -- 
   The MON-8K.m51 file is the map file generated by the linker.

-- mon-int-sio0.hex (formerly mon-8k.hex) -- 
   A version of the monitor for the Keil debugger that 
   uses only internal memory.  Download this file
   with the control panel prior to using it with the Keil debugger. 
   This version uses sio 0 and loads at 0x0000-0x1075.
-- mon-int-sio0.m51 (formerly mon-8K.m51) -- 
   The MON-8K.m51 file is the map file generated by the linker.

-- ezmon-ext-sio0-c0.sys
   This monitor can replace ezmon.sys to use SIO-0 by default.
   If you are debugging GPIF waveforms on the EZ-USB FX, you need to 
   manually load mon-*-sio0*.hex prior to debugging your GPIF application.
   This is because the sio1 monitors use PORTB which is disabled when
   IFCONFIG [1..0] is set to a value of 0x2 for GPIF Data (GDA[7..0]) pins. 
   This setting precludes use of the Keil debugger on SIO1 since PORTB is 
   where TXD1and RXD1 pins are located and this conflicts with the GPIF 
   Data (GDA[7..0]) pins. To avoid this use SIO0 for the Keil Debugger.
   If you want to avoid manually reloading the debugger every time you reset, 
   you may want to use ezmon-ext-sio0-c0.sys. In the same manner that 
   the normally installed file named ezmon.sys contains the default 
   monitor (which is normally mon-ext-sio1-e0.hex for EZ-USB FX), this
   file contains mon-ext-sio0-c0.hex.
   This would make sense if you are debugging a GPIF program on FX since 
   you do not want the default monitor in that case. To use it, you would 
   replace C:\windows\system32\drivers\ezmon.sys with ezmon-ext-sio0-c0.sys
   (after changing the name of "mon-int-sio0.sys" to be "ezmon.sys").
